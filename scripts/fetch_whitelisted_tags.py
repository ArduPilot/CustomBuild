"""
This script automates the listing of tagged versions of
the ArduPilot source code from various white-listed forks
from GitHub on the Custom Build Server.
It performs the following tasks:

1. **Fetch Tags**: Utilizes the GitHub API to retrieve the list of tags from
   the specified remote repository.
2. **Filter Tags**: Identifies tags that start with the prefix 'custom-build/'.
3. **Update remotes.json**: Adds information about these custom-build tags to
   the `remotes.json` file, enabling building these versions.

Tag Naming Conventions:
- Tags named in the format `custom-build/xyz` are allowed to be built
  for all vehicles.
- Tags in the format `custom-build/vehicle/xyz` are allowed to be built
  for the specified vehicle only.

Examples:
- A tag named `custom-build/some-test-work` will be listed under all
  the vehicles.
- A tag named `custom-build/Copter/some-test-work` will be listed under
  Copter only.

Note:
- Vehicle names are case-sensitive. e.g., copter is not Copter.
